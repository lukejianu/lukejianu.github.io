Hi, I'm Luke, and I work on software at [Palantir](◊pltr-site).

In the past, I've:

- load tested a distributed OLTP database at [Databricks](◊db-site).

- built a TCP stream proxy at [Belvedere Trading](◊bt-site).

- improved [Comprehensive Device Management](◊cdm-site) at [Amazon Robotics](◊ar-site).

- created tooling for high-speed cameras at [S3Global](◊s3-site).

- TA'd a bunch of great classes: [CS2500](◊cs2500-site), [CS2800](◊cs2800-s25-site) ([2x](◊cs2800-s24-site)), [CS4500](◊cs4500-site).

You can find other relevant links and my contact information on my [CV](/LukeJianu_Resume.pdf).
