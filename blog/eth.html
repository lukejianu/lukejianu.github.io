I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. I soon decided to quit. - Vitalik Buterin</p></blockquote><p><em>In progress!</em></p><h3 id="bitcoin">Bitcoin</h3><h4 id="the-idea">The Idea</h4><p>Bitcoin is a ledger: an ordered list of transactions.</p><pre><code>Ledger

1. Alice sent Bob 2 coins    - Signed by Alice.
2. Bob sent Charlie 4 coins  - Signed by Bob.
3. Charlie sent Alice 1 coin - Signed by Charlie.</code></pre><p>The ledger represents the balances of each person, which one can easily compute by iterating over the transactions and tracking the movement of coins. Of course, in the example above, Alice and Bob end up with negative balances (debt), which we probably don&rsquo;t want to allow. We&rsquo;ll return to this later. An interesting observation here is that this ledger is its own <em>currency</em>. That is, if everyone used this same ledger, we wouldn&rsquo;t need dollars anymore.</p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s important property is that it is a <em>decentralized ledger</em>, which means that the ledger is not controlled or managed by a particular entity. This immediately raises questions. Who keeps track of the state of the ledger? Who decides how the ledger is updated?</p><p>In order for this ledger to be useful, there needs to be consensus on its state. Without a single source of truth, how could a seller trust that the buyer&rsquo;s transaction is set in stone?</p><p>Governments use voting to reach consensus on policy. Could we have everyone vote on what the state of the ledger should be? The proposed ledger with the most votes becomes the new ledger. This seems decentralized—anyone is allowed to propose a new ledger and vote, which means that no entity controls the ledger. It&rsquo;s the majority that controls the ledger, which is exactly what we want.</p><p>Recall, however, that an important part of voting is identity verification: every person is only allowed to vote once. Our voting system is vulnerable to Sybil attacks, in which an attacker creates many identities to gain more influence in the vote. A minority of bad actors could overwhelm the majority, and we lose the decentralized property.</p><p>Bitcoin uses a very clever voting mechanism. Your voting power increases based on your computing power. This way, the only way for an entity to control the ledger is to own the majority of compute, which would be extremely expensive. The way it works is that all members are always racing to solve a computationally difficult math puzzle. The members with more compute are more likely to solve the puzzle. When a member solves it, they gain the right to propose a new ledger. The ledger contains a stamp with the solution they found, so that others can quickly verify that they solved the puzzle. This stamp is known as the <em>proof of work</em>.</p><p>Of course, the new proposed ledger must be valid. It should only add transactions and those transactions should have valid digital signatures. The proposed ledger should also not represent any negative balances—you can&rsquo;t spend what you don&rsquo;t have. Even with a valid proof of work, the other members will ignore the proposed ledger if it isn&rsquo;t valid.</p><p>The proposer expended resources in the form of computation to solve the puzzle. This is an important job that needs to be performed in order to keep the ledger growing (and running). Thus, the proposer is rewarded for solving the puzzle. They reward themselves by adding a transaction to the proposed ledger granting themselves a few coins. This is how new tokens are created (think back to how this solves the negative balance problem in the example ledger above).</p><p>A more general way to think about Bitcoin is as a decentralized database. The nodes in the network agree on the state and exchange messages expressing how they would like the state to change or transition. In Bitcoin&rsquo;s case, the state is a mapping from ID to balance, and the transitions are transactions.</p><p>Namecoin is an implementation of decentralized DNS inspired by Bitcoin. The state is a mapping from ID to (name, address) and the transitions are claims to certain domain names, updates to domain names, etc.</p><h4 id="the-implementation">The Implementation</h4><h3 id="ethereum">Ethereum</h3><h4 id="the-idea">The Idea</h4><ol><li>Introduce Ethereum, whose state has the ledger, code, and memory (like a computer). Explain the state and state transitions. This effectively makes it a general purpose blockchain. There are many applications that run on the Ethereum blockchain. This is what people mean when they say web 3.0.</li></ol><h4 id="the-implementation">The Implementation</h4><h4 id="aside-proof-of-stake">Aside: Proof of Stake</h4></root>
